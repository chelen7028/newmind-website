				We start by looking at overall owner-occupancy and corporate-ownership rates across the 
				years to address any data quality issues. This dataset includes values from 2004 to 2024 
				and overall there do not seem to be any outliers. Although the sum of these rates do not 
				add to 1.0, this is most likely accounted for by the lack of rates for properties that are 
				not owner-occupied but are owned by an individual or family rather than a corporation. This 
				difference could also be due to the fact that corporate ownership is determined via keyphrase 
				matching, as mentioned in the metadata, so a few corporate-owned properties could be left 
				out. 
				<p> 
					Our first step is looking at how overall owner-occupancy rates (shown in green) and 
					corporate-ownership rates (shown in blue) have changed from 2004 to 2024. Here, we can see 
					that owner-occupancy rates and corporate-ownership rates are almost inversely proportional: 
					median owner-occupancy rates have decreased from 2004 to 2024, whereas median corporate ownership 
					rates have increased. This chart shows that corporate ownership rates have increased over years, 
					but further analysis needs to be done to determine whether this growth of corporate ownership 
					rate is constant across all regions of Boston, or if certain neighborhoods are seeing more 
					corporate ownership than others.

				Looking at geographic data, I noticed that multiple zip codes were linked to a neighborhood 
				named Downtown, even though the respective regions are on different sides of Boston. To avoid 
				any confusion, I excluded all neighborhoods named Downtown from analysis. Additionally, the 
				Corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates in Boston neighborhoods, 2004-2024 dataset 
				does not have data for the Back Bay and Mission Hill neighborhoods, so these are also excluded 
				from future analysis. Comparing the other neighborhoods with other maps, the general regions 
				looked accurate.

				<p>
				The map above shows the median corporate ownership rate from 2004 to 2024. Notably, South Boston 
				Waterfront, Roxbury, Longwood, and Allston have the highest corporate ownership rates. On the 
				flip side, Roslindale and West Roxbury have the lowest corporate ownership rates.

				To better understand how corporate ownership rates have changed over time, I calculated the difference 
				between rates in 2024 and 2004 and mapped that to various neighborhoods of Boston. From this chart, 
				we can see that the highest area of growth in corporate ownership is in East Boston, Beacon Hill, Charlestown, 
				Longwood, and the South Boston Waterfront – all of which are in the northeast portion of the city. These 
				areas have much overlap with the areas with high median corporate ownership rates from the previous chart, 
				suggesting an interesting observation where corporate owners are choosing to buy in areas that are already 
				densely populated with other corporate owners rather than expanding to other neighborhoods. Why is this the 
				case? Does this have to do purely with simple supply and demand, or are other factors at play?

				<figcaption>
				Before further exploring the relationship between corporate ownership rates and housing prices, 
				I examined the overall change in price of housing over time. In order to look at the 
				change in house prices, I focused on price difference values between consecutive transactions. 
				Moreover, I normalized the price across different property sizes by determining the price per 
				interior square foot. This chart shows the change in median price difference per interior square
				foot from 2000 to 2023. As you can see, 2023 has a median of 0, suggesting that there is not 
				much data for the year of 2023 yet, so all 2023 values can be excluded from other analyses. 
				Additionally, we observe an irregular dip from 2006 to 2012. This can be explained by the subprime
				mortgage crisis which started in 2006, which later led to the Great Recession, whose effects lasted
				through 2011.

				This map shows the median price of houses bought from 2000-2023. The South Boston Waterfront 
				and Charlestown neighborhoods are the most expensive. These two neighborhoods were also among 
				the neighborhoods with high corporate ownership rates from the previous figures.
